#Java Air (Airport Challenge re-done in Javascript)

We are learning Javascript in our fifth week at Makers Academy and in order to practice, I translated my Airport Challenge project from Week 1 (originally written in Ruby) into Javascript in order to aid my learning of a new language and test my understanding of new language syntax, conventions and patterns. This helped me work towards one of my ultimate goals at Makers of being equipped for long-term growth.
